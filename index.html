        <h1>Guide to the USDA Nutrient Database API</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The USDA Food Composition Databases are a vast collection of various generic and branded foods and their
                nutritional information. In an effort to provide Americans with the information needed to make healthy
                dietary
                choices, the databases give information regarding the calorie, macronutrient, and micronutrient content
                of
                many
                foods.</p>
            <h3>Getting an API Key</h3>
            <p>To get an access to the USDA Nutrient Database API, you first need to get an API key. This key is used to
                trace
                who is making requests to the API and limit the number of request from any given user. Because the
                databases
                are
                a subset of the Data.gov project, an API key must be acquired at their <a href="https://api.data.gov/signup/">sign-up page</a>.
                Incidentally, the API key you get from Data.gov can also be used to access the
                various other U.S. Government APIs, such as those of the FDA, NASA, and the FCC. When you sign up, you
                will
                immediately receive a key by e-mail, which you can then incorporate into your requests.</p>
            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>Because it is a government project, there are few limitations on the use of the database for anyone. It
                is
                free
                to use, and it is in the public domain, so it can be used without permission in your own projects.</p>
            <p>There are, however, a couple caveats. First, any given API key is limited to 1,000 requests per hour. As
                the
                API
                documentation explains, this shouldn’t be an issue if you incorporate the API key acquisition process as
                part of
                the registration process in your app, so that every user has his/her own key. If you do manage to exceed
                the
                rate limit, you will be blocked from the database for one hour, so keep that in consideration. If you
                genuinely
                need more than 1,000 requests per hour per API key, the writers of the documentation recommend
                contacting
                them
                for an increase. The contact information can be found <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/nutrient-data-laboratory/docs/how-to-get-information-from-ndl/">here.</a>
                </p>
            .<p>
            In addition, although citations are not required, the documentation authors list a couple ways to cite the
            database
            if you are so inclined:
            <ul>
            <li>U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service. 20xx. USDA National Nutrient Database for
            Standard
            Reference, Release . Nutrient Data Laboratory Home Page, http://www.ars.usda.gov/nutrientdata</li>
            <li>U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service. 20xx. USDA Branded Food Products Database .
            Nutrient Data Laboratory Home Page, http://ndb.nal.usda.gov</li></ul></p>
            <h3>Type of Reports</h3>
            <p>The database provides two main types of reports: food reports and nutrient reports.</p>
            <p>Food reports are reports that list the nutritional information of specific foods in the database. Your
                request
                will specify which food you’re interested in, and you’ll get back a response containing the nutritional
                information for that food.</p>
            <p>The other kind of report is a nutrient report. In this report, you specify which nutrient you’re
                interested
                in,
                and the response is a list of foods with how much of the nutrient they contain. The list of foods can
                include
                all the foods in the database, or it can be limited to specific food groups.</p>
            <p>To help you figure out how these types of reports work without having to build your own app, the USDA
                website
                provides browser-based search tools that let you generate both kinds of reports. Here are the pages for
                <a href="https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list">food
                reports</a> and <a href="https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/nutrients/index">nutrient reports.</a></p>
            <p>Now that you know how to get access to the database with your own API key and what type of information
                the
                database can give you, let’s get into the <a href="https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/3771?manu=&fgcd=&ds=">meat</a>
                and <a href="https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/3084?manu=&fgcd=&ds=">potatoes</a> of how to format your API
                requests
                to take advantage of the database.</p></section>
        <section><h2>User Guide</h2>
            <p>All the requests from the Nutrient Databases are formatted as GET requests. The base URL for all requests
                is
                http://api.nal.usda.gov/ndb/ with a variety of parameters that you can add on to the end. As explained
                above,
                there are a couple types of reports you can get back from the database. This section will explain how to
                request
                both food reports and nutrient reports.</p>
            <h3>Food Reports</h3>
            <p>Food report requests are very simple to create, given that you already know the NDB number of the food
                you’re
                looking for. There are only four parameters for a simple food report request, and only two are really
                required.</p>
            <p>First, you need your API key, which is specified in the api_key parameter. And second, you need the NDB
                number.
                This is a unique identification number that every food in the database has. For example, the NDB number
                for
                a
                generic regular crust 14” cheese pizza is 21299. To search for the nutritional information for cheese
                pizza,
                you
                would then use the parameter ndbno. Finally, there are two optional parameters. The first is the type,
                which
                specifies how detailed you want the food report to be. The type can either be basic, which is the
                information
                you would find on a nutrition label; full, which contains additional nutrients that appear in the
                database;
                and
                statistical, which provides detailed statistical information about the nutrients. Note that branded
                products
                will only have a basic report, no matter what type you specify. The last parameter is the format, which
                is
                either XML or JSON. However, this can also be specified in the request header. So, enough talk, let’s
                see
                how we
                can make an AJAX request to find out how many calories are in a slice of pizza.</p>
            <p>To start out, we can assign our API key to a variable to make it easy to reference it later. For this
                purpose, I
                will use the demonstration key provided by the API documentation, although you would use your Data.gov
                API
                key
                for your own app.</p>
            <p><code>var APIkey = "DEMO_KEY";</code></p>
            <p>Now, let’s create a new <code>XMLHttpRequest()</code> object so that we have an interface to communicate with the
                database’s
                servers.</p>
            <p><code>var req = new XMLHttpRequest();</code></p>
            <p>How will we format our request? We know our API key and our NDB number from above. We also only need a
                basic
                report because calories (energy) are listed on a nutrition label. Finally, we can request our report in
                JSON
                format so that we can easily use the response in our app. Here’s how it looks fully assembled:
                <a href="http://api.nal.usda.gov/ndb/reports/?api_key=DEMO_KEY&ndbno=21299&type=b&format=json">link</a>.</p>
            <p>If you follow that link, you should see a report for the nutritional information for a 14” cheese pizza.
                Let’s
                get Javascript to initialize an asynchronous GET request to that URL for us:</p>
            <p><code>req.open(“GET”, “http://api.nal.usda.gov/ndb/reports/?api_key=” + APIKEY +
                “&ndbno=21299&type=b&format=json”,
                true);</code></p>
            <p>Now we can add how we’re going to parse the response and extract the information we want. Because it is
                an
                asynchronous request, we will start by adding a listener to our req object:</p>
            <p><code>req.addEventListener(“load”, function(event){});</code></p>
                <p>And now we can replace the function with one that actually reads the response from the request:</p>
                <p><code>req.addEventListener(“load”, function(event){
                var response = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
                });</code></p>
            <p>Finally, we want to extract the information about the calories in a slice of pizza from our response
                objects.
                This is where it gets a little more complicated. Because the basic report gives us information about a
                variety
                of nutrients, we have to figure out how to find the “energy” nutrient. The least ambiguous way to access
                the
                nutrients (and the only way to access them via the API) is with a nutrient_id. This makes things a
                little
                more
                difficult because, like your ndbno, you need to know your nutrient_id before you can access information
                about
                that element. There is a way to get a list of nutrients with their correspond nutrient_id values, which
                is
                described below, but for now, here are the most common ones:</p>
            <table class="table table-bordered">
                <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Nutrient</th>
                    <th>ID</th>
                </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Calories</td>
                    <td>208</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Fat</td>
                    <td>204</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Carbohydrates</td>
                    <td>205</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Protein</td>
                    <td>203</td>
                </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>Now that we know the nutrient_id, we can use it to find the information for our given nutrient. To help
                you
                follow along, you may want to open the URL for the API request above.</p>
            <p>We start at the report key, which contains the entire report. Then, we move down to the food key, which
                contains
                all the information about the food rather than any metadata. Since we’re interested in nutrient
                information,
                we
                move to the nutrients key, which points an array of objects for various nutrients. We now need to find
                the
                one
                with the correct nutrient_id, which we can do using Javascript’s Array.prototype.find() function (see
                the
                documentation for this function to find out how it works). Then, we move down to the next key, called
                measures,
                which is another array that contains the different ways the food can be measured in the label attribute.
                So,
                we
                can once again search this array for the measure with the label of “slice”. Finally, we access the value
                attribute, which is the caloric content of one slice of cheese pizza.</p>
            <p>Here is a Javascript version of that last paragraph:</p>
            <p><code>var energy = response.report.food.nutrients.find(function(nutrient) { <br />
                return nutrient.nutrient_id=="208"; <br />
                }).measures.find(function(measure) {
                return measure.label=="slice"; <br />
                }).value;</code></p>
            <p>After all that, we now have our caloric content saved in a variable, called energy. We can add that to
                our
                event
                listener, along with a console.log() so we can see what the value is in the end.</p>
            <p><code>req.addEventListener(“load”, function(event){
                var response = JSON.parse(req.responseText);<br />
                var energy = response.report.food.nutrients.find(function(nutrient) { <br />
                return nutrient.nutrient_id=="208";
                }).measures.find(function(measure) {
                return measure.label=="slice";
                }).value; <br />
                console.log(“Cheese pizza has” + energy + “ calories per slice!”); <br />
                });</code></p>
            <p>Now that our listener is set up to parse our response, we can safely send our request:</p>

            <p><code>req.send(null);</code></p>

            <p>And that’s it! If you run that all in Javascript, you should see “Cheese pizza has 285 calories per
                slice!”
                in
                the console.</p>

            <p><a href="https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/doc/apilist/API-FOOD-REPORT.md">Click here</a> for a list of all the other response elements.
                Now let’s look at the other type of report.
            </p>
            <h3>Nutrient Reports</h3>

            <p>The database also allows you to make a request for a nutrient report, which allows you to list foods with
                their
                content of a specific nutrient (or nutrients). This list can range from all the foods in the database, a
                specific food group, or one specific food. So, instead of searching through the JSON to find the
                calories
                for
                cheese pizza like we did above, we could specify that we want the API to only return information for
                energy
                (nutrient_id=208).
            </p>
            <p>If you navigate to <a href="https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/doc/apilist/API-NUTRIENT-REPORT.md">the nutrient report documentation</a>, you will see the full
                list of
                parameters you can send in the request, which includes food group, nutrient (required), sort order (by
                food
                name
                or nutrient content), the number of items to display, and the NDB number (if you have a specific food in
                mind).</p>

            <p>Let’s say you’re trying to get ripped, and you wanted to find out which food has the most protein per
                serving.
                How would we format the request? We want to search for protein (nutrient_id=203 from the table above),
                and
                we
                are not limited to a specific food group. In order to get the item with the most protein, we need to
                sort by
                nutrient content, which is signified by the value c. Here’s how our request would look:
                <a href="http://api.nal.usda.gov/ndb/nutrients/?format=json&api_key=DEMO_KEY&nutrients=203&sort=c">link</a>.</p>

            <p>If we then set up our AJAX request like we did last time, we will find what we’re looking for using the
                following
                properties of our response:</p>
                <p><code>var mostProtein = reports.foods[0].name;</code></p>

            <p>If you output that to the console, you would find that raw turkey breast has the most protein per serving
                in
                the
                database. Thankfully, the second most protein-rich item in the database is roasted turkey breast, so you
                won’t
                have to eat raw poultry to get that beach body!</p>

            <h3>Searches and Lists</h3>

            <p>One issue that we’ve come across in formatting our queries is that many of the parameters we need require
                numeric
                codes instead of their actual names. So how can we find out what elements correspond to what codes?</p>

            <p>The database lets you make queries for lists of foods, nutrients, and food groups, which will let you
                find
                the
                code to place in our future queries. The basic way to format a list query is:
                <code>http://api.nal.usda.gov/ndb/list?format=json&api_key=DEMO_KEY&amp;lt=g&sort=id</code>
            </p>
            <p>In this case, you will receive a list of food groups, sorted by ID. If you change the lt attribute to f
                or n,
                you
                will instead get a list of foods or nutrients, respectively. A caveat for nutrients: if you’re looking
                for
                most
                normal macronutrients, they will appear at the beginning of the list, but if you’re looking for
                something
                more
                obscure, you’ll need to change the max parameter, which will default to only 50 items per list.
            </p>
            <p>What if you have a specific food in mind and want to find its NDB number using its name? The API also
                provides a
                search functionality at http://api.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search. You just enter the name of the food in the q
                parameter and sort by relevance or name. To see how this can be used in your own app, check out
                <a href="https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list">the database search page</a>, and notice how the search box gives a drop-down box of
                possibilities
                as you enter text.</p></section>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>This start-up guide should give you the tools you need to get started making an app using the USDA
                Nutrient
                Databases. For example, you could try making a recipe calculator that determines the total calories for
                a
                list
                of ingredients.</p>

            <p>For any more detailed technical information, see the <a href="https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/api/doc">full API documentation
                <a>.</p>
